Faces
This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate new human face images. The model is trained on a dataset of human faces and uses a discriminator and generator to create realistic-looking faces.

Overview
The GAN consists of two main components:

Generator: Takes in random noise and generates new human face images.
Discriminator: Evaluates the authenticity of the generated images against real human faces.
Key Features
Training: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of human faces to learn the underlying patterns and features.
Generation: Once trained, the generator can produce new, realistic human face images.
Evaluation: The discriminator helps in refining the generatorâ€™s output by distinguishing between real and generated images.
